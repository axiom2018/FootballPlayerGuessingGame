/** Reasoning for this interface:

Use the first class abstract data type to create an interface for the world of the game so we can carry out critical operations to run the game.


                                                                                Interface variables:

1) Reasoning for WorldPtr:

Standard part of the abstract data type in c is to have a typedef struct in the header file.


                                                                                Interface functions:

1) Reasoning for World_Init:

Standard part of the abstract data type in c is to have a function to initialize the pointer.


2) Reasoning for World_Update:

Allow the World to go through the motions of managing the player and cpu in a single function and make the main.c file very simple and easy.


3) Reasoning for World_ClearScreen:

Refresh the screen.


4) Reasoning for World_Destroy:

Standard part of the abstract data type in c is to have a function to destroy the pointer to prevent memory leakage.
